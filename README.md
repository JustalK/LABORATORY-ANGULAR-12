# LABORATORY ANGULAR 12

## Goal

This project is my playground for testing and experimenting with angular. That's basically a project showing some aspect of `Angular` that I am trying to master. Most of the experience come from the official documentation but as it is sometime hard to understand, I am going around and try to find a better tutorial.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.
